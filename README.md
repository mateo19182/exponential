## About Mateo

From A CoruÃ±a, Spain. I'm currently working as a ML Engineer at [Audialab](https://audialab.com), doing freelance work in the fitness sector and as a music producer. I'm passionate about learning niche subjects, you can read more about me in my [blog](https://blog.m19182.dev). 

### Main Achievements

- **MemberMetrics** Built it with 2 friends and presented at FIBO2025. Got some companies interested, we are working on making it more featureful.
- **Beats19182** For producers to organize and share their beats, fully self-hosted, is used by 2 other producers.
- **Emergent Drums 2 local inference** Led the move of inference workloads from our servers to the user's device at Audialab. 

### Most-Prideful Builds

### Some personal stuff

- Built a [homeserver](https://blog.m19182.dev/writings/Building-my-Homelab) where I do ML workloads and host different projects.
- I really enjoy making [music](https://music.m19182.dev/) (Ableton), as well as [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@mateo_19182) (Blender, TouchDesigner, Resolume). I also play the drums in a band with some friends.

- Spent much of my university years producing, mixing and mastering music for local artists. Also DJ'd in clubs and festivals. Don't do this as much anymore, but it's still a part of my life.

- I write, both in my [blog](https://blog.m19182.dev/writings/) and in a [music newsletter](https://no-cosign.m19182.dev/) I have with some friends.

- I read a lot. Mostly substacks and blogs I follow (my [link archive](https://blog.m19182.dev/link-archive) has most of it), but also books, mostly science fiction.

- I have listed some other things I like on my [here](https://blog.m19182.dev/things-i-like) and also have a [now page](https://blog.m19182.dev/now) that keeps track of what I'm up to.

- Used to do triatlon, now just running.

### My vision

I want to be surrounded by very competent people and do meaningful work that has an impact on the real world. I'm triying to maximize the chances of this happening any way I can.
